R1. Misconfiguration  of networks,"The fact that more components from different suppliers need to be integrated together, the use of virtualisation management and the lack of mature MNO processes for complete lifecycle of Open RAN deployment greatly increase configuration complexity and the risk of misconfiguration of networks and render faults more likely. Moreover, the lack of mature standards can lead to dissimilar and potentially poorer network design and architecture which increases the risk for ineffective emergency and continuity mechanisms. Decoupling hardware and software, and using software component from different suppliers present potential additional risk of misconfiguration of networks. Software may offer security feature, which relies on hardware implemented secure element, or security feature which requires support from other software component. As there may be many different combinations of software and hardware, or combinations of software components, integrating the security features may require additional effort and could easily end up to situations in which security features are not used.",FALSE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R2. Lack of access  controls,The increased number of Open RAN suppliers also means an increasing number of third parties needing access to the network (e.g. in case of malfunction). The new functions (for example xApps and rAPPs) will introduce new suppliers in the ecosystem and will require additional security controls and measures to be put in place between each and every function to avoid new security threats being introduced. MNOs may need to outsource the operations to third parties given the increased complexity and additional interfaces in Open RAN deployments. The use of open interfaces also increases the risk of a third party accessing the system.,FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
New Risk (NR) 1. Expanded threat surface and vulnerabilities in Open RAN functions and interfaces,"The increased number of components in Open RAN deployments, potentially from multiple suppliers, together with new network functions as well as additional Lower Layer Split (LLS) interfaces, increase the attack surface. Also, the implementation of network functions with AI and ML introduces new attack vectors, for example through flaws in the ML model or via the interface to external sources (such as weather data). For instance, the O-RAN Alliance specifications, in their current version, include the possibility for external, potentially untrusted, sources to provide data to intelligent RAN functions and to configure the network intelligently, but these interfaces have not been further defined/described. Vulnerabilities in these interfaces and intelligent functions could negatively impact the network. In addition, by opening certain interfaces, Open RAN will give access to information flows to new third-party applications, which raises security issues with regard to data passing through the network. The O-RAN specifications already define capacities for opening certain interfaces to thirdparty applications. These openings aim to introduce new functionalities, but these third-party applications will have access to information flows (e.g. real-time location data of users connected to the network).

Risk Scenario: Adversary exploits insecure open fronthaul interface to mount denial of service, interception or tampering attacks, compromising availability, confidentiality, integrity or privacy of data. Alternatively, attackers may exploit weak authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorised access, compromise privacy, degrade network performance or facilitate attacks on other parts of the network.",TRUE,TRUE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R3. Low product  quality,"Open RAN means that there will be more suppliers and more different components, potentially including components from high-risk suppliers. This means that the risk of diverse levels of quality product increases. It is unclear whether newcomers in the Open RAN market might prioritise innovation or security in the short-term. In addition, there may be suppliers whose maturity of software development, software security and supply chain security is lagging behind with respect to more established suppliers. A compounding factor is the fact that Open RAN standards are still under development and lacking maturity. This means that Open RAN products may lack a foundation of security-by-design. Considering that these components are interconnected, additional controls will be needed to avoid that these weakest links put other components and the other RAN functions at risk.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R4. Dependency,"An increased number of available suppliers, coupled with a disaggregated RAN, interoperable interfaces, an increased use of COTS hardware and possibly open source software could reduce the overhead in switching suppliers, allowing operators to reduce the potential for dependency on any single suppliers (See also under ‘Supplier diversity in the RAN’ in annex 2).",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR2. New dependency on cloud service/infrastructure providers in Open RAN,"A potential (and likely) implementation of Open RAN's modular approach for the RAN functions, and the disaggregation of software from hardware, enables (part of) the base station software to be run on cloud platforms, which could increase dependency on cloud service/infrastructure providers. As different suppliers may use different cloud platforms, there is a risk that the network becomes dependent on multiple cloud service/infrastructure providers at the same time. There is a possibility that the cloud service or part of it is run outside the EU where different legislation may apply. There may be also situations where all MNOs in a region end up using the same cloud provider. In this case, even if each of the MNOs has its own network, all the networks are relying on the same cloud provider, which could then exacerbate vulnerabilities.  Risk scenario: Mobile network operators rely entirely on a small number of (mostly non-EU) cloud service/infrastructure providers for their Open RAN network supporting critical infrastructure, which creates a supplier lock-in.",TRUE,FALSE,"O-Cloud, SMO",,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR3. Decreased sustainability of the EU 5G supply chain and potential dependencies on non-EU capacities,"The RAN supply market could be transformed in a way that gives momentum to new players (e.g. system integrators, cloud service/infrastructure providers, etc.), including large non-EU players. This could lead to new critical dependencies in the midto long term, or increase existing ones30, with potentially significant impacts on security.  Risk scenario: New business models based on Open RAN architectures and interfaces gain momentum and new major players enter the market, competing with the established players. The market could reconsolidate around a small number of non-EU suppliers, system integrators and cloud providers, thus negating the diversification opportunity.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR4. Deficiencies in the O-RAN technical specifications development process,"Security has not been at the forefront of the technical specifications development process of the O-RAN Alliance31 32. Immature O-RAN specifications without a foundation of secure by design may lead to products with increased vulnerabilities leading to exploitation. The lack of mature security specifications in a diverse Open RAN architecture coupled with increased competition can result in poorly manufactured components in an attempt to reduce cost. In addition, key decision rights within the O-RAN Alliance are conferred to the Board, which is composed only of a sub-set of members and only of MNOs. The participation in the specification development of the O-RAN Alliance seems to narrow as the process advances. The combination of conditions for document access and for membership seems to imply that while the documents may eventually be accessed by anyone, conditions to access specifications are more stringent for non-members and non-contributors. The stringent provisions of the O-RAN Alliance Adopter License Agreement might hamper the transfer of information and knowledge between adopters and non-adopters, making discussions outside the O-RAN Alliance more difficult.  

Risk scenario: O-RAN specifications continue to be developed in a setting which does not provide much visibility and openness to relevant stakeholders, and a lack of parity with the 3GPP international standardisation efforts. This weakens efforts towards ensuring a coherent secure architecture, can fragment the overall system security and create vulnerabilities in availability, integrity, confidentiality and privacy.",TRUE,TRUE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R5. State interference through 5G supply chain,"As there will be more suppliers in an Open RAN deployment (including possibly more high-risk suppliers), the potential exposure to a higher number of supply chain risks increases. The risk profile of a supplier - linked to the criteria identified in the EU Coordinated risk assessment (including the risk of interference by third country) - continues to be an important source of vulnerabilities.

R6. Exploitation of 5G networks by organised crime,"The increased number of interfaces and suppliers would offer more opportunities for OCGs to enter and disrupt the network. In addition, smaller suppliers, such as those providing software services, may be more susceptible to be influenced by OCGs (or state actors). Moreover, the possible use of open source components could mean that the vulnerabilities are publiclyknown and could therefore be more easily exploited by malicious actors.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R7. Significant disruption of critical infrastructures or services,Identified risks related to Open RAN (in particular new vulnerabilities related to an increased number of suppliers and new interfaces which translate into a higher risk of exposure to network-level attacks compared to the established access network implementations) and the lack of fully mature security controls around Open RAN architecture and NFV mean that critical national infrastructures relying on 5G networks could also be more exposed to incidents. .,TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R8. Massive failure of networks due to interruption of electricity supply or other support systems,"This risk can affect the RAN, and the impact would depend on the split of functions in the 3GPP or Open RAN specifications. In case of power supply disruption, a network using a distributed architecture could be impacted at a larger extent due to the physical distance that exists between the physical equipment/hardware hosting central unit (CU) and/or distributed unit (DU) functionalities. It is therefore important to ensure that adequate energy back-up sources are installed in multiple physical points in order to protect service availability in a single/particular area.",FALSE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
R9. IoT exploitation,"Open RAN components, the network functions running on them, but also for example virtualised MEC applications, would be vulnerable to attacks from connected terminals, such as IoT devices, but the risk would be similar for network components in an established RAN architecture.",FALSE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR5. Open RAN network fault management complexity,"Failure in specific network components built by a specialised supplier may impact the entire network. Multiple suppliers may increase complexity and cost of managing network services and fault management, by making it more challenging to discover the cause of network failures or by requiring (remote) support provided by several different suppliers, hence increasing the risk. In addition, more Open RAN suppliers could mean it is harder to allocate and enforce liability to one or more suppliers.

Risk scenario: An unintentional system failure in one of the critical components built by a specialised supplier and the complexity of identifying and resolving the issue in the multi-vendor set-up impacts the availability causing prolonged outage of network services.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR6. Impact of Open RAN mix and match approach on network security and performance,"Integration of multiple supplier components into a single network, in particular in the lack of a mature standard, which by its nature enables efficient interoperability, can cause integration problems, prevent specific security controls to function or make it more difficult to conduct network testing. Moreover, an increasingly complex environment with multiple components from different suppliers and with multiple stakeholders involved makes it more challenging to ensure that only trusted and competent individuals are involved in network deployment, operation and maintenance. Additionally, the increased number of components and interfaces and/or the application of necessary resource-demanding protection mechanisms on those elements may also lead to degradation of overall performance or prevent specific use-cases dependant on performance such as ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Furthermore, the ability of the MNO to pursue a systematic approach to security controls across the network is impeded by a diversity of security mechanisms. In addition, different releases of the same software might be deployed in a heterogeneous way.

Risk scenario: Unintentional human error in operating and managing complex network environment or an intentional malicious action by a non-trustworthy third-party personnel with high access privileges lead to unavailability of network services or facilitate further attacks on other parts of the network.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
NR7. Resource sharing,"In Open RAN, different network functions are virtualised and are running on the same hardware, which means that potentially, if there are not sufficient controls in place, other network functions could be impacted by security issues with other new RAN functions running on the same pool of resources.  

Risk scenario: If one non-critical network function is running alongside other network functions on the same pool of hardware resources, then a security incident affecting the non-critical network function, for example an overload or distributed denialof-service (DDoS) attack, could impact the security of other network functions.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Report on the Cybersecurity of Open RAN
Coordinated Vendor Disclosure,"Integration and compatibility between Open RAN components and functions from different vendors is critical to network security. Since it is crucial to update devices as quickly as possible, additional delays may introduce risks for network operators. For example, if a zeroday vulnerability is identified, vendors could release patches at different times. If one vendor’s device is patched in response to a critical vulnerability, and others are not, it could lead to incompatibility of network devices and loss of network service availability. Until all the vendors within a network release a patch for the exploit, the operator’s network may be vulnerable.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Component Lifecycle,"When a network operator implements a change, such as an update, service implementation, or addition of a new component, they must ensure that there are no negative impacts to the network. While traditional networks require testing, Open RAN will introduce more complexity, which may present challenges for operators since that interoperability will need to be tested before each network change throughout the device’s lifecycle.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Triaging Vulnerabilities,"When a vulnerability arises within an Open RAN network, identifying which vendor is responsible for addressing it may require more extensive coordination between vendors. In a traditional network with limited vendors, responsibility would fall on the vendor to identify and repair the issue. With an Open RAN network, it may be difficult to identity which vendor is responsible when there is component incompatibility that will require the operator to bring multiple vendors together to remediate the issue. Operators may be less likely to implement security changes if vendor coordination is too difficult or time consuming.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Improper Implementation of Specifications,"Devices must utilize defined Open RAN standards and specifications that support the development of open interfaces, network flexibility, and multi-vendor network support.

OFH Denial of Service,"The availability of a mobile network to provide service to a subscriber is an imperative for mobile operators. The ability to provide a mobile service is dependent on the availability of the Open Fronthaul. The Open Fronthaul attack surface comprises the real-time communication interfaces, management interfaces, and the Open Fronthaul network. From a security perspective, the Open Fronthaul must implement security controls to counter potential denial of service attacks against the ability of a mobile network to provide services.",FALSE,FALSE,,Fronthaul Interface,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Unauthorized Access to OFH,"One security concern is unauthorized device access to the Open Fronthaul network. Only ORU radios, O-DU in the base station equipment, and other authorized network devices should operate on the Open Fronthaul. An unauthorized device on the Open Fronthaul could launch denial of service attacks on the RAN. Mitigations for unauthorized access include network access control mechanisms, hardening and other O-RU physical security measures, and access control on O-RU management functions.",FALSE,FALSE,,Fronthaul Interface,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Insufficient Authentication for OFH,The O-RAN Alliance defined management interface for the O-RU allows the operator to optionally use certificate-based authentication with mutual TLS5 or password-based authentication with SSH. Password-based authentication is considered weak and vulnerable to brute force attacks. Weak authentication can be exploited by a malicious actor to gain access to the local system and move laterally across the network to gain access to northbound systems for greater visibility and control across the RAN. Authentication on the O-RAN Alliance defined management interface with mutual TLS (1.2 or 1.3) comprising Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based X.509 certificates will move the O-RAN alliance defined management interface toward adopting an accepted industry best security practice.,FALSE,TRUE,,Fronthaul Interface,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
AI/ML Data Poisoning Attacks,"AI and ML algorithms in Open RAN components can behave unpredictably or maliciously when subject to “data poisoning attacks”, subtle changes to input data that could be indistinguishable from random noise. Therefore, AI and ML algorithms deployed in Open RAN components should be chosen, trained, deployed, and updated using approaches that harden them against data poisoning attacks. Open RAN also proposes AI and ML algorithms be implemented in a modular way to allow for independence and re-use across software components. For supervised algorithms, like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), it is recommended that offline training with known data precedes deployment.

When AI and ML algorithms are introduced into a software system, they can present additional and novel vulnerabilities that need to be understood and mitigated. By “poisoning” the data input to an AI and ML algorithms, an attacker can induce effects ranging from denial of service by one or more Open RAN components to unexpected output from an AI or ML module that alters Open RAN behavior to the attacker’s benefit.  

Protecting AI/ML against data poisoning attacks is still a growing field of investigation. Appendix A list four widely referenced papers that will enable an experienced practitioner to develop, test, and deploy AI/ML algorithms that are robust against a variety of attacks. Appendix B lists published attacks on AI and ML used in RANs.",FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",,Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations
Cloud/5G RAN Operator Takeover,"The “cloud operator” and “5G RAN operator” attackers have prominent positions. Both ultimately have full control over the RAN: the 5G RAN operator by design, and the cloud operator because the current O-RAN specifications do not provide for security measures regarding untrusted cloud operators. It simply assumes that cloud operators can be trusted: “Administrators, integrators, operators and orchestrators must be trustworthy, ...” [49].  As a result, there are no differences in the O-RAN-related best-case/worst-case considerations with regard to “cloud operator” attackers. The same applies to “RAN operator” attackers, who, among other things, have full control over the O-RAN security safeguards. Therefore, only worst-case (ww) and best-case (bb) considerations are generally made below. 

Worst case: If none of the 3GPP or O-RAN security safeguards specified as optional are implemented, the risk of a breach is to be assessed as high for all protection goals and for all stakeholders, since in this case the cloud operator/5G RAN operator has full access to all processed data and full control over the data processing itself. The only exception here is the end-to-end protection of the Control Plane data with regard to integrity. This improves the situation for the 3GPP Control Plane data, but the internal O-RAN configuration and management data are unprotected, which results in a medium risk overall. 

Best case: Even the best-case situation is only negligibly better. For all stakeholders, failure to meet the protection goal of availability represents a high risk. From their perspective, end users must also assume a violation of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity, privacy and accountability, since the cryptographic keys for securing the air interface (Uu) are known to the RAN. Since such an attack is easy to carry out across the board, a high risk is also seen with regard to “state” stakeholders and the violation of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity, accountability and privacy. For the “telco” stakeholder – specifically from the Control Plane perspective – the situation is slightly better, as the corresponding Control Plane messages (NAS) between UE and the core network are end-to-end secured (between UE and the 5G core). However, manipulations of the O-RAN-specific configuration and management data are possible, resulting in the assumption of a medium risk overall.",FALSE,TRUE,ALL,ALL,Open RAN Risk Analysis
Compromised O-Cloud Access,"The O-Cloud is the central execution environment of the O-RAN components. As mentioned above, an untrustworthy cloud operator results in very high security risks. The same applies in the case of an O-Cloud compromised by an attacker. This is why effective security safeguards such as access control and separation are crucial. The O-RAN specifications only make a few stipulations here and even contain security-critical requirements. For example, the “Security Requirements” specification [51] contains only a recommended requirement for access control: “User should be authenticated and authorized.” On the positive side, isolation mechanisms certainly are required: “Means of isolation of control and resources among different users shall be implemented” – although such isolation mechanisms are ineffective without mandatory user authentication. In the O-RAN worst case, a risk situation arises with regard to “outsider” attackers that is comparable to the situation involving “RAN operator” attackers, since a compromised O-Cloud is essentially equivalent to full control over the O-RAN components. The best-case scenario from an O-RAN perspective cannot be assessed at present, as there are practically no security requirements for the O-Cloud.",FALSE,TRUE,O-Cloud,,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O2 Specification Gaps,"As described in chapter 2.3.2, the O2 interface is used to configure the O-Cloud and deploy the RAN components of O-RAN, i.e. the VNFs. The O2 interface can be considered very powerful in that it can be used to determine the entire execution environment and the software components that are executed. This is all the more true since the deployment scenarios and use cases found in the O-RAN documents provide for a great deal of flexibility, and the O2 interface must therefore be powerful enough to support this dynamic. Unauthorised access to the O2 interface has the potential to compromise the RAN, i.e. to give an attacker complete control over the entire RAN. 

A detailed risk assessment is currently difficult since requirements are only described or specified in terms of the services to be made available with the help of the O2 interface. The exact details of how the interface is designed, however – that is, which concrete protocols are used, and so on – are not specified (“The O2 services and their associated interfaces shall be specified in the upcoming O2 specification”. [27])

The authors of the O-RAN specifications are well aware that the O2 interface must be secured, as they have defined the general requirement REQ-O2-GEN-TLS-FUN-1 and REQ-SECO2-1. However, these are formulated in fairly “soft” terms: “Management Service providers and consumers that use TLS shall support TLS v1.2 or higher” [26]. The use of security protocols (specifically TLS) is therefore not prescribed in principle; only a minimum TLS version is specified if TLS is used. The associated explanatory description, “Communications between SMO and O-Cloud are secure”, [26] can thus be described as misleading, as it represents more a wish than a fact or requirement that can be derived from the specification.

In addition to simply securing the connection (e.g. with the help of TLS), it is also important to define exactly which components or roles are allowed to use which management and deployment services. Based on this, corresponding rights management and access control must be implemented. It is important that the O2 interface has to be designed to support implementation of the least privilege principle in a natural way, i.e. that the interface offers welldefined functions with well-defined parameters that enable sufficiently granular rights management. The opposite of this would be more of a general interface – remote access via SSH, for example. Here, a clear determination of the capabilities of a principally authorised person and the implementation of corresponding restrictions on said capabilities are very complex and error-prone.

As mentioned, the exact design of the O2 interface is unclear, but the O-RAN software community does provide a reference implementation. This is based on a number of existing software components, such as OpenStack, Kubernetes and ONAP. These basic components are highly complex on their own, which makes misconfigurations likely [52] and in turn represents a vulnerability to potential attacks (e.g. privilege escalations) in the case of a less restrictive O2 interface.",FALSE,TRUE,,O2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O2 Takeover (A),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP worst case (ww): Since no security mechanisms are mandatory, even an outsider can access the powerful O2 interface and take complete control of the RAN. This may result in a failure to fulfil the protection goal of availability for all the stakeholders considered. With regard to the end user, a failure to meet the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability of transmitted data must also be assumed, since the attacker can gain control over the relevant encryption keys. With regard to the 5G network operator/telco, failures to fulfil the protection goals of confidentiality, accountability and privacy are to be expected. This affects all data relevant to the O-RAN, such as configuration data (including cryptographic keys), machine learning models, O-RAN software components (including rApps and xApps), log files, etc. Since a corresponding attack can easily be carried out on a large scale, a high risk with regard to all protection goals can also be assumed for governmental (“state”) stakeholders. However, integrity is an exception from the network operator's point of view: even if a RAN is completely taken over, the Control Plane data between UE and AMF should be secured by the mandatory integrity assurance measures using 3GPP mechanisms.",FALSE,TRUE,,O2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O2 Takeover (B),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP best case (wb): Here, the assessment of the risks is analogous to that of the worst-case/worst-case scenario. However, the Control Plane data is encrypted by the 3GPP specifications between UE and AMF in the best case, which means that the risk to the confidentiality protection objective can be classified as “medium” with regard to the “telco” stakeholder because the other O-RAN-specific Control Plane data is unprotected.",FALSE,TRUE,,O2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O2 Takeover (C),"O-RAN best case/3GPP best case (bb): Since all the optional security safeguards are implemented in this case, a low probability of successful attacks by outsiders and users seeking to exploit the O2 interface can be assumed. With regard to “insider” attackers, on the other hand, a high probability can be assumed. Since there are no concrete statements on rights management or granular access control to the O2 interface, it can currently be assumed that insider attackers can expand their rights with relative ease. This is especially true if the component compromised by the insider is the SMO framework. By securing the O-RAN area, the risk of a failure to fulfil the availability protection goal should decrease, since incidental access to the O2 interface from the outside and by the user should no longer be possible.",FALSE,TRUE,,O2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O2 Takeover (D),"O-RAN best case/3GPP worst case (bw): The risks of failures to meet the protection goals should be assessed here in the same way as the best-case/best-case scenario. The only difference is that no Control Plane data is encrypted between UE and AMF, which raises the risk from “medium” to “high”.",FALSE,TRUE,,O2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O1 Insufficient Security,"Optional security safeguards are provided for the O1 interface in the current specification documents. Specifically, SSH and TLS are cited here [25]. The implementation of the least privilege principle is also mentioned. 

It should be noted that the Security Requirements document [51] makes more strictly formulated statements compared to the actual O1 interface specification: “O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity through an encrypted transport, and least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model”. However, some of the concrete requirements only use the phrase “shall support”, whereas the same document's notes on the security controls to be used are stricter: “As defined in the previous chapter, the O1 will use TLS 1.2 or higher to enforce confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity; and will use NACM [10] to enforce least privileged access”.",FALSE,TRUE,,O1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O1 Takeover (General) (A),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP worst case (ww): Since no security mechanisms are mandatory and the O1 interface – at least with regard to the (O-)RAN core functionality – is similarly powerful to the O2 interface, the considerations from chapter 5.1 apply in the same way. However, the risk of an integrity violation is classified as medium from the network operator's point of view. Due to the mandatory integrity assurance of the Control Plane data (only NAS signals) on the part of 3GPP, it should not be possible for even an insider to change the Control Plane data exchanged between UE and AMF without being noticed. However, an insider still has access to the Control Plane data in the O-RAN, which is why the integrity violation is classified as medium.",FALSE,TRUE,,O1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O1 Takeover (General) (B),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP best case (wb): Here, the consideration is similar to the worstcase/worst-case scenario: since integrity assurance of the Control Plane data exchanged between UE and AMF is mandatory, the 3GPP best case does not offer improvement compared to the 3GPP worst-case scenario. Although the UE's User Plane data is now encrypted and its integrity secured, an attacker can access the corresponding keys via the O1 interface, so the risk remains unchanged. An important difference, however, is that the Control Plane data between the UE and AMF is encrypted from end to end in this case. From the network operator's point of view, the risk here is therefore assessed as medium because regardless of all the other considerations, the O-RAN-specific Control Plane data is unencrypted.",FALSE,TRUE,,O1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
O1 Takeover (General) (C),"O-RAN best case/3GPP best case (bb): As in the case of the O2 interface, the circumstances regarding the O1 interface look better in the best case due to the (optional) security safeguards provided. In relation to “user” and “outsider” attackers, the risk of a breach of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability is assessed as low for all stakeholders. In the case of availability, the risk for all stakeholders is rated as medium. An attacker could target the availability of the O1 interface to prevent configuration changes and status messages. This in turn can lead to impairments of the quality of service of the RAN – that is, to successful availability attacks on the RAN itself. It should be noted here that, in contrast to the specification of the E2 interface, a failure of the O1 interface is currently not explicitly considered in the specification documents. Since the O1 interface allows software management, an insider with access to this interface can in principle manipulate the executed O-RAN components and thus, as already detailed, gain access to stored cryptographic keys (for example) in the case of the O-CU. The decisive factor here is how strictly the least privileged principle is implemented and what rights a given insider actually has as a result. The risk an insider poses to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability with regard to the “user” and “state” stakeholders is therefore assessed as medium. A similar assessment is made for the “telco” stakeholder. Although parts of Control Plane communication are secured from end to end (and thus protected against insider access), the O1 interface provides access to a great deal of network management information that is sensitive from the network operator's point of view (in terms of both confidentiality and integrity/accountability).",FALSE,TRUE,,O1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis

O1 Spec. Ambiguity,"In [53], the O1 interface between the O-DU and SMO is used for “start up” installation and the management of software, configurations, performance, faults and files. For the security of the connection, the use of TLS is to be mandatory for the authentication of the O-DU, although the mandatory nature is usually rarely found in the specifications in this way. In addition to this, securing the NETCONF data exchange by means of TLS is supposed to be mandatory: “In this version of O1 Interface Specification, the security of the NETCONF protocol is realized using TLS” [53].

Use of the NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) is also supposed to be mandatory to enforce least-privilege access control. In general, the specification mainly covers the mandatory implementation of security mechanisms in contrast to the security mechanisms in 5.3.1.

Although the enforcement of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability is not mentioned with the usual terminology using “shall”, the formulation: “[...] the O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity [...] and least privilege access control [...]”.

However, the basic availability attacks that prevent certain status and configuration messages cannot be prevented. As in the general assessment of the O1 interface, it can also be said that “user” attackers pose a low risk of violating the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability. An insider, on the other hand, can breach the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability in the worst case, since the O-RAN protection measures cannot compensate for the 3GPP safeguards that do not apply here. Here, the O-DU is assumed to be an “insider”. In addition, an insider may be able to install their own software on the O-DU in the worst case (depending on their membership in rights groups) and thereby gain control of it. This results in a high risk to availability.

With regard to availability, it can be argued that even in the best-case scenario, an insider cannot inject malware through NACM, as they do not have the necessary rights.

A1 Interface Specification Gaps,"As described in chapter 2.3.3, the A1 interface is primarily used to communicate guidelines to the near-real-time RIC regarding the configuration/optimisation of the RAN. These guidelines are designed as declarative policies. They express what is to be achieved, but not how it should be achieved. The concrete implementation decisions are thus part of the near-real-time RIC and the xApps.

The A1 interface is meant to provide options for enforcing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity (including protection against replay attacks) [51]. For this purpose, TLS is provided as an option for securing communications [57], [51], [49]. One threat to the A1 interface arises from the fact that, in order to implement bidirectional communication, it is intended that both end points (non-real time RIC, near-real time RIC) of the A1 interface act as servers [57]. The attack surface resulting from the open ports necessary for this should be minimised by having only one endpoint act as a server and carrying out bidirectional communication via an existing connection. To implement this, additional techniques such as reverse connections can be used.

With regard to the best-case/worst-case analysis, it should be noted that the corresponding risks here are essentially dependent on the best-case/worst-case situation pertaining to the O-RAN specifications. In contrast, due to the functionality of the A1 interface, the resulting risk is largely independent of the best-case/worst-case situation regarding the 3GPP standards.",FALSE,TRUE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",A1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
A1 Interface Attack (Worst Case),"Worst case: Since the A1 interface is unsecured in the worst case, it is possible for outsiders to gain read and write access to it. By manipulating policies accordingly, an impairment of availability (reduction of service quality) is possible at the very least. A high risk to availability is thus assumed for all stakeholders.

With regard to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability, a low risk is assumed for the user perspective even in the worst case, as no current attacks could be identified that would allow an attacker with access to the A1 interface to read or manipulate the User Plane data.

It should be noted here that more in-depth analyses are needed to actually rule out the possibility that no User Plane data is transmitted via the A1 interface. Particularly in future versions of the specifications, it will be essential to check which services are actually offered via the A1 interface and whether User Plane data is transmitted there.

With regard to the “telco” perspective, this risk assessment changes to “medium”, since sensitive network management information (with regard to confidentiality and integrity) is transmitted via the A1 interface. This assessment was also adopted for the “state” perspective.",FALSE,TRUE,,A1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
A1 Interface Attack (Best Case),"Best case: Due to the protection with TLS in the best case, neither an outsider nor a user can successfully attack the confidentiality or integrity of the A1 interface. Only availability attacks on the A1 interface are conceivable. Due to the functionality of the A1 interface, it can be assumed that intelligent availability attacks on this interface can impair the availability of the RAN – at least in the sense of a reduction in quality of service. This applies in particular because a failure of the A1 interface is not explicitly considered in the specifications. A medium risk is therefore assumed for all stakeholders here.

Since the security safeguards only provide protection against outsiders (connection encryption) and a rights and role concept regarding access control to the A1 interface can be inferred between the lines of the specification at best, it is currently assumed that an insider has full access to the A1 interface even in the best-case scenario. The situation pertaining to insider attackers is therefore similar to that of the worst case involving an outsider. On the other hand, no current attacks could be identified that would enable an insider to gain a significant advantage with regard to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability based on access to the A1 interface. The comments made above regarding the need for a more in-depth analysis should be noted here.",FALSE,TRUE,,A1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
R1 Interface Specification Gaps,"As explained in chapter 2.3.4, the R1 interface is used by the rApps to access non-real-time RIC functions and other services that an rApp needs to fulfil its tasks. Here, the following is envisaged: “The R1 interface is the sole interface between an rApp and the functionality of the Non-RT RIC and SMO. Therefore, the R1 interface should be defined to meet all functional needs of rApps, with appropriate interface extensibility capabilities as needed.” [29]. The R1 interface is thus to be regarded as very powerful. At the same time, it is currently largely unspecified. There are some general statements and some requirements, but no concrete design. The following information is relevant from a security point of view:

- “It would be useful for the O-RAN Alliance to define an open and standard interface through which the Non-RT RIC exposes SMO Framework functionalities to 'rApps' via the R1 Services exposure functionality. We will refer to this as the 'R1' interface” [29]
- ""Capabilities are offered for consumption and usage through the R1 services. Such services include, but are not limited to: A1-related services, O1-related services, O2related services, ...” [29]

The way in which the interface is designed is also unclear. A certain assumption can be made that the API calls are internal and do not take place via a network interface between different computers. Among other things, this assumption arises from the fact that the R1 interface is not mentioned in various O-RAN documents regarding the new, open interfaces. Conversely, based on the general definition of the R1 interface – “R1 Interface: Interface between rApps and Non-RT RIC framework via which R1 Services can be produced and consumed” [58] – it cannot be ruled out that the R1 interface is implemented as a network-based interface. Within the framework of this study, it is therefore assumed with regard to the best-case scenario that the R1 interface only deals with internal APIs; in the worst-case consideration, it is assumed that the R1 interface is accessible via the network.

Security safeguards are not currently specified for the R1 interface. It is only mentioned with regard to rApps that access to R1 services should only be possible after authentication and authorisation. Details on how this is to be implemented are also not specified at present. Due to the principle connection of O1, O2 and A1 services and the lack of current restrictions regarding the use of these interfaces, the risk analysis for the R1 interface is based on the results for the O1, O2 and A1 interfaces. The highest risk for one of these interfaces is regarded as the lower bound of the respective risk for the R1 interface. From a risk perspective, the R1 interface cannot be better than the O1, O2 or A1 interface (in the worst case).

It should also be noted that for the best-case/worst-case considerations, the situation regarding the O-RAN specifications is decisive. In the O-RAN worst case, the O1/O2 interface can be used to take control of the O-RAN components. Therefore, any 3GPP security safeguards implemented in this case can barely take effect, or they can be circumvented. Conversely, in the O-RAN best case, misuse of the R1 interface is prevented, which is why the implementation of 3GPP protective measures is less crucial. One exception here is the telco perspective with regard to the protection goal of confidentiality: in the best case, the Control Plane is afforded end-to-end protection, which also offers protection in the O-RAN worst case.",FALSE,TRUE,,R1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
E2 Interface Specification Gaps,"As detailed in chapter 2.3.5, the E2 interface is primarily used to manage the E2 nodes. In the course of this, a service (“RAN Function Network Interface (NI)” [59]) makes it possible to observe and change all data traffic on the network interfaces of the E2 nodes with the help of the E2 interface. Among other things, the following specific services are offered:

- “Copy of Complete message with header providing network interface type, identifier and direction with optional network interface timestamp”
- “Injection of Complete message with header providing target network interface type, identifier and direction and optional RIC Control Message Priority”

These services present a high risk potential from a security perspective. Meanwhile, the security safeguards provided for in the specification are currently considered optional. One specific requirement states that the E2 interface “shall support confidentiality, integrity and replay protection” [30]. A similar statement is also found in [51]. IPSec is proposed as a means of protection in [49]: “IPSEC: Should be used to protect E2 traffic” (similarly in [51]: “For the security protection at the IP layer on E2 interface, IPsec shall be supported”).  Based on the functional capabilities of the E2 interface and the corresponding security safeguards, the associated risks are assessed below.",FALSE,TRUE,,E2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
E2 Interface Attack (A),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP worst case (ww): Since no security safeguards are implemented in the worst case – apart from integrity protection of the Control Plane data – and the E2 interface allows full access to all 3GPP data traffic on the E2 nodes, a high risk to confidentiality, availability and accountability is essentially assumed for all stakeholders. With regard to “telco” stakeholders, a medium risk is assumed due to the 3GPP integrity assurance of the Control Plane data, as O-RAN-specific (configuration) data is unprotected at the same time.",FALSE,TRUE,,E2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
E2 Interface Attack (B),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP best case (wb): The situation changes here, as the 3GPP security safeguards offer protection related to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability. The only question here is the extent to which “insider” attackers can gain access to the keys for securing the User Plane or to the unencrypted User Plane data. In principle, the corresponding keys are available in the CU. Further analyses are required to be able to exclude such risks with certainty, which is why the risks at hand are assessed as “medium”.",FALSE,TRUE,,E2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
E2 Interface Attack (C),"O-RAN best case/3GPP best case (bb): In the best case, the E2 interface and the 3GPP interfaces are secured. An outsider can therefore essentially only carry out denial-of-service attacks on the E2 interface. A low risk to confidentiality, integrity and accountability is therefore assumed for all stakeholders.

“Stupid” DoS attacks only have a limited effect here, as the O-RAN specifications stipulate that the RAN should be functional even if the E2 interface fails. However, it must be assumed that the RAN is functional with a limited quality of service – otherwise there would be no need for an E2 interface. Furthermore, the effects depend on the concrete design of the E2 node in question. By cleverly manipulating data traffic on the E2 interface, an attacker can achieve a high computing load at an E2 node due to the cryptographic operations associated with IPSec. In extreme cases (if separation is not implemented well), this could lead to insufficient computing power being available for the actual tasks of an E2 node. The extent to which “intelligent” DoS attacks can lead to a more severe impairment of quality of service also remains unclear. Attacks that deliberately delay data packets in such a way that the detection mechanisms regarding a failure of the E2 interface (timer, etc.) are not yet triggered are conceivable in this context. Furthermore, the extent to which it is possible to assign encrypted data traffic to individual E2 services or E2 functions in spite of IPSec encryption (for example, through traffic analyses regarding specific service communication traffic patterns) must also be investigated. This would enable the targeted disruption of individual E2 services or E2 functions and could lead to more severe effects compared to a complete “failure” of the E2 interface. Overall, the risk outsiders pose to availability is therefore considered medium with regard to all stakeholders.

At present, the position of “user” attackers is only slightly better. One new risk/threat stems from a user's ability to generate data traffic pertaining to the User Plane and Control Plane that can be regarded as legitimate in principle. The user can cleverly design this data traffic in such a way that it is included in the analysis and evaluation functions provided by the E2 interface (with regard to the 3GPP interfaces). Depending on how concrete these analysis and evaluation functions are, this influence can be seen as a springboard for further attacks. This is especially the case if the corresponding systems were not developed on the premise that recorded analysis and evaluation data should be regarded as potentially malicious in principle. For example, cleverly crafted User Plane or Control Plane data could be used for buffer overflow or injection attacks (SQL injection, etc.). It is also possible to influence the training of machine learning based on recorded data. Overall, such attacks are likely to primarily impact availability at first. However, since it is assumed in principle within the framework of the bestcase analysis that all systems work without errors, the overall risk assessment is not higher than in the case of an “outsider” attacker.

In the context of an insider, the attacker is assumed to have access to the E2 interface. A good example of this is an xApp. There is general talk of “policies” and “authorisations” with regard to xApps here and there in the specifications, but since there is no differentiation at all and no rights management is apparent with regard to the current specification of the E2 interface, it is currently assumed that an xApp can use the E2 interface without restriction, even in the bestcase scenario. If this is not the case for an xApp, it is very likely to be for the near-real-time RIC component.

Due to the assumed access to the E2 interface, availability attacks are easily possible for an insider, resulting in a high risk for all stakeholders. In terms of confidentiality, integrity and accountability, the perspective of an end user depends on which component the insider controls. If this component has both access to the E2 interface and knowledge of the keys used to secure the Uu interface, the risk is high. If the insider cannot access the cryptographic keys, the risk is low. As a general consequence, a medium risk is assumed here. This risk assessment is also adopted for the “state” stakeholder. With regard to the “telco” stakeholder, the situation is somewhat better on the one hand, since the Control Plane data traffic is secured from end to end. On the other hand, the E2 interface enables the “exposure of selected E2 Node data (e.g. configuration information (cell configuration, supported slices, PLMNs etc.), network measurements, context information, etc.) towards the Near-RT RIC” [30]. This data is regarded as sensitive trade secrets and, since it forms a basis for network operation, the data's integrity is considered important. A medium risk to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability is therefore assumed with regard to the “telco” stakeholder.",FALSE,TRUE,,E2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
E2 Interface Attack (D),"O-RAN best case/3GPP word case (bw): Since the E2 interface is secured in the O-RAN best case, there are no direct options for “user” and “outsider” attackers to use the E2 interface for attacks. For an insider, accessing an E2 interface with no 3GPP security safeguards makes it possible to successfully breach almost every protection goal from nearly any perspective (again, with the exception of the integrity protection of the Control Plane data, which is also present in the 3GPP worst case). This results in a correspondingly high risk.",FALSE,TRUE,,E2 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
Open Fronthaul M-Plane Software Injection Attacks,"The Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface makes it possible to manage the O-RU components as described in chapter 2.3.7. Particularly relevant from a risk perspective is the possibility of using the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface to perform a software update with regard to the O-RU components. In principle, this enables an attacker to take full control of the O-RU by importing appropriately manipulated software. In accordance with the O-RAN specification, software protection is not strictly defined: “The use of compression and ciphering for the content of the software build is left to vendor implementation. The only file which shall never be ciphered is the manifest.xml file” [32]. However, the manifest in particular contains information that should be protected from manipulation. A special risk arises from the fact that with the help of the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface, the download URL can be freely specified with regard to the software to be installed. It would be better to provide for restrictions here so that the configured host in the O-RU (for example) is “fixed”, which would limit the negative effects of possible manipulations in the transmission of the download URL (redirection to a server under the control of the attacker).",FALSE,TRUE,O-RU,Fronthaul Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
Open Fronthaul M-Plane Configuration Attacks,"In addition, it is assumed that access to the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface facilitates successful attacks on availability, since the configuration data stored in the O-RU can be changed with the help of the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface. This in turn can be used to impair quality of service or cause a complete functional failure of the O-RU.",FALSE,TRUE,O-RU,Fronthaul Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
OFH-M Security Specification Gap,"In contrast to almost all other interfaces, the considerations for securing the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface are comparatively extensive and could even be seen as mandatory depending on one's interpretation. Specifically, the use of SSH (for which support is mandatory) or TLS (optional) is possible here. To minimise risk, the use of SSH should be dispensed with in favour of TLS (as already detailed in connection with the O1 and O2 interfaces). With regard to security, mutual authentication is mandatory.

The room for interpretation regarding mandatory applicable security mechanisms is mainly due to the unclear wording in the specification documents, such as in the statement: “The M-Plane provides end to end security as a mandatory feature.” [32] However, a “feature” is a property or capability of a component and therefore does not have to be applied. In contrast, a subsequent table states that the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability are implemented – however, the reason given here only refers to the basic support for SSH or TLS, but not to their mandatory use. As listed later in the table “Mandatory and Optional Features for O-RU Authentication”, all authentication mechanisms are marked as “optional to use”. It would be better to clarify here – if this is the intention of the specification – that although each individual mechanism is optional, at least one is mandatory.",FALSE,TRUE,,Fronthaul Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
OFH-M Default Credentials for Privileged Accounts,"Overall, however, the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface contains many considerations with regard to security. It should be noted here that the description of the Open Fronthaul interfaces is also significantly more extensive overall compared to the other interfaces.

With regard to security, it should also be mentioned that a rights/roles concept is provided. There are six roles mentioned in the specification:
- sudo
- smo
- hybrid-odu
- nms
- fm-pm
- swm

With regard to the rights, a distinction is made between read, write, and execute. The rights for various functional groups (referred to as “namspace” in the specification) are then determined on the basis of the role in question. The role “sudo” has the most privileges. It is intended as an administrative role and thus grants full access to the O-RU, including the option to create users and assign roles to them.

The fact that a default user with a default password and “sudo” rights is provided for out-ofthe-box is not considered advisable with regard to the current specification. In the literature, it is frequently reported that default access of this kind is a starting point for successful attacks – no matter how strongly users are advised to change their default access data during initial setup. Here, mechanisms should be provided that enable initial setup without a known default user name and password – for example, by randomly generating this data and attaching it to the O-RU as documentation.",FALSE,TRUE,O-RU,Fronthaul Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
OFH-M Attack (A),"O-RAN worst case/3GPP worst case (ww): Assuming that the O-RAN security safeguards are also mandatory in the worst case, “user” and “outsider” attackers pose a low risk to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability for all stakeholders. However, due to the unclear formulations and the associated uncertainty as to whether the O-RAN security safeguards really have to be implemented, they are upgraded to a medium risk. Similarly, a medium risk is assumed with regard to availability, since availability attacks on the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface are possible as previously described for the other interfaces. Since no explicit statements regarding the tolerance of a failure of the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface could be found, it is also assumed with regard to the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface that cleverly executed availability attacks can lead to an impairment of RAN service quality.

With regard to “insider” attackers, the situation is somewhat different. An insider with access to the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface can update the software on the O-RU components, which in turn gives them access to the User Plane and Control Plane data transmitted via the Uu interface. As this data is not protected further in the worst case, it is fully exposed to manipulation – hence the assessment of the corresponding risk as “high” for all stakeholders. Only the integrity of the Control Plane data exchanged between UE and AMF is unaffected by this. Since this data has mandatory integrity protection, the related risk is low. However, it is assumed that there is also (network management) data in the O-RU that is sensitive from the telco point of view (with regard to confidentiality, integrity and accountability) and can be accessed by an insider.

As a result, an insider cannot break the confidentiality or integrity of the Control Plane data, which is why the risk here is also assessed as medium overall.

A lower risk can only be assumed for the integrity of the Control Plane data due to the end-to-end protection between UE and AMF.

OFH CUS Attack (B),"3GPP best case (bb): For the “user” perspective, the situation improves in the best case with regard to the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability, since the Uu interface is secured by 3GPP security safeguards. In the case of accountability, the risk is assessed as medium, since 3GPP does not provide any protective measures in this regard and a user (in contrast to an “outsider” attacker) can import User Plane messages into the system that are recognised as correct during integrity checks.

Availability attacks on the Open Fronthaul CUS Plane interface also impact the usability of the 5G system as a whole, which is why a high risk to availability is assumed even in the bestcase scenario.

The 3GPP protections ensure that “insider” attackers also pose a low risk to the User Plane data transmitted on the Uu interface, since the symmetric keys used for protection are located in the O-CU.

The Control Plane data exchanged between UE and AMF is secured by the safeguards provided in the 3GPP best case, resulting in a lower risk for the network operator.

OFH CTI Attack,"The CTI interface facilitates capacity reservation in the transport network that is used for the Open Fronthaul CUS plane. This is meant to ensure sufficient resources are always available to meet the high bandwidth and latency requirements of the Open Fronthaul CUS plane, especially in the case of a transport network shared with other services. It is currently assumed that reconfiguration of the network paths themselves (using the CTI interface) is not planned. In this respect, attacks on or access to the CTI interface do not result in any violations of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity, accountability or privacy. It should be noted that only a digital signature is currently provided as a safeguard for the CTI interface, and its exact specification will only be defined in the future (“The full details of the CTI Signature will be specified in a future version of this specification.”) [33] This makes it possible to ensure integrity and accountability. Confidentiality, on the other hand, is not guaranteed. An attacker may thus be able to obtain information about network management and related strategies by eavesdropping on the CTI interface, which must be taken into account in particular with regard to the “telco” stakeholder. It should be noted that the aforementioned digital signature is optional. Furthermore, it is unclear how the mechanism is to function in concrete terms. A bit is provided in the CTI header that signals whether a digital signature is being used. Since this bit itself is not protected, it remains unclear whether the intended digital signature can actually have a meaningful protective effect.

Since the availability of the 5G RAN (especially with regard to the Uu interface) is to be ensured with the help of the CTI interface, availability attacks on the CTI interface itself enable corresponding attacks on 5G RAN availability. In the worst case, “outsider” attackers are assumed to pose a high risk to all stakeholders. The best-case scenario, meanwhile, may indeed be somewhat better due to the digital signature. Since it is unclear whether the current design of the digital signature can actually have a meaningful protective effect, a medium risk is assumed – especially because attacks that suppress CTI messages are possible despite the digital signature and the current specifications do not explicitly take into account a failure of the CTI interface.",FALSE,TRUE,,Fronthaul Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
Malicious Data Risks,"In particular, the other interfaces include those used for accessing/downloading external “enrichment information”, the AI/ML interfaces and the human-machine interface intended for SMO. The exact design of these interfaces is largely unspecified at the moment. With regard to access to enrichment information, it is envisaged that this should only take place via secure connections. In any case, this interface and the AI/ML interface represent a security risk in that untrusted providers of the associated information and data can influence management and configuration decisions of rApps/xApps. At the very least, this makes an impairment of availability possible. It is currently not assumed that a direct violation of the protection goals of confidentiality, integrity and accountability is possible with regard to the 3GPP User Plane and Control Plane data.

However, it should be noted here that the data provided by potentially untrustworthy external sources can also be cleverly generated to exploit possible security vulnerabilities (buffer overflow, etc.) in the processing components (especially in the rApps/xApps) and thereby take control of the affected components. The effects of this depend to a very large degree on the component compromised, the rights it has and the extent to which an escalation of privileges is possible. In principle, this can also result in a high risk for the other protection goals. The human-machine interface is designed to enable a person to influence the SMO components (e.g. in terms of their configuration). The concrete security risks associated with this depend very much on the – currently essentially unspecified – possibilities offered by this user interface. If, for example, it allows software updates to be applied to the various O-RAN components, then it is possible in principle to compromise these O-RAN components, which leads to security risks comparable to those stated in chapter 5.1 in terms of “RAN operator” attackers.",FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",External Interfaces,Open RAN Risk Analysis
rApp Access Control Ambiguity,"According to the specification, the R1 interface should be the only interface available to rApps. In this respect, the risk analysis for the R1 interface is an essential basis for the risk analysis of rApps. The only point to note here is that the specifications generally speak of access restrictions of individual rApps with regard to the R1 interface; how exactly this is to be implemented, the associated rights and role concept and, in particular, how granular a possible rights management system can be in restricting access to the R1 interface is currently unclear.",FALSE,TRUE,Non-RT RIC,R1 Interface,Open RAN Risk Analysis
rApp Isolation Requirements,"Besides the R1 interface, further threats arise from the fact that it can be assumed that a given rApp will be executed in a common hardware/execution environment together with other rApps and SMO functionalities. In the specifications at least, there is no indication that strict (physical) separation is planned with regard to rApps. Insufficient separation and isolation thus represent a possible vulnerability. This is especially true since one planned approach for implementing rApps is to use container-based separation (for example, with the help of Kubernetes). It should be noted that the original objective of separation using containers was not necessarily isolation for security reasons, but rather to avoid dependencies on the runtime environment provided by the operating system. This is why the separation mechanisms implemented and applied in current container solutions are relatively weak. As a result, there is a danger that an rApp could break out of isolation and thereby escalate the privileges granted to it.",FALSE,TRUE,"Non-RT RIC, rApps",,Open RAN Risk Analysis
rApp Parser Attacks,"From the “user” attacker perspective, it is conceivable to carry out parser attacks with the aim of exerting influence on an rApp through cleverly manipulated user data; in extreme cases this can lead to a compromise of the rApp. However, the data basis (in terms of message formats) for a risk assessment is not available, which is why this is only pointed out here.",FALSE,FALSE,"Non-RT RIC, rApps",,Open RAN Risk Analysis
rApp Language Attacks,"Furthermore, the specification does not specify the programming languages to be used for the implementation of an rApp. In principle, this allows the use of rather “insecure” programming languages such as C or C++, where the probability of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attacks (e.g. through buffer overflows) is significantly higher than with “secure” programming languages such as Rust. Since the communication between rApps is an essential design element of the overall architecture, a malicious rApp could exploit programming errors in other rApps to gain control of a vulnerable rApp and then carry out malicious activities using the privileges granted to that rApp.",FALSE,TRUE,"Non-RT RIC, rApps",,Open RAN Risk Analysis
xApp Attack,"For the risk analysis for xApps, the same considerations apply as for rApps. The main difference is that the xApps have access to the A1 and E2 interfaces. In this respect, the risk analyses regarding these interfaces form the basis of the assessment. In addition, the xApps are “closer” to the 3GPP interfaces (Xn, NG, X2, E1, F1) because the xApps are part of the Central Unit (CU). Should an xApp succeed in breaking through the isolation mechanisms (assuming these are in place), there is a more immediate danger of the 3GPP User Plane or Control Plane data being accessed (in contrast to rApps14). Whether a higher security risk can be derived from this in general compared to rApps depends on the future, more concrete design of the respective frameworks and interfaces, since unlike xApps, rApps have the “advantage” of being able to access the O1 and O2 interfaces. In the following, it is conservatively assumed that both types of apps face the same risks with regard to the relevant security objectives.",FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, xApps","A1 Interface, E2 Interface",Open RAN Risk Analysis

AI/ML Data Poisoning,"In addition to the general uncertainties resulting from the use of machine learning (where decisions are based on correlations, not causalities), from a security perspective there is the particular problem that numerous attacks are known that negatively influence the trained model with the help of manipulated input data. The result is a trained model that either generally delivers incorrect results during inference (application of the model) or – and this can be the greater risk for some use cases – delivers a correct result in almost all cases and only delivers the incorrect result desired by the attacker in situations that can be determined by the attacker. Based on the potential attacks described and the way in which machine learning is to be used in O-RAN according to the current specification – which is still quite general and unspecific with regard to machine learning – it is assumed that there is a medium risk to availability (i.e. quality of service may be negatively affected). Depending on which parameters are specifically included in the training of a model, legitimate RAN users always present a certain minimum level of risk, adding to the risk already posed by outsiders.",FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",,Open RAN Risk Analysis
AI/ML Model Stealing,"From the operator's (telco's) point of view, another security risk is that the confidentiality of the trained model itself may be compromised. The assumption here is that trained models represent sensitive assets, i.e. they should not become known in the sense of a trade secret. In the literature, there are corresponding “model stealing” attacks that can allow an attacker to derive the parameters of the model or at least to (strongly) restrict their respective range of values by means of clever queries or by manipulating the system either on the basis of the answers or generally on the basis of the reactions of the system. Whether such attacks can actually be carried out successfully in the case of O-RAN depends to a large extent on the concrete application scenario of a given model. Due to the current lack of clarity, a medium risk for the telco is assumed here because even outsiders could carry out successful attacks, and at minimum, (supposedly) legitimate RAN users certainly could as well.",FALSE,FALSE,"Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC",,Open RAN Risk Analysis
Supply Chain Risks,"While the introduction of Open RAN architecture provides an opportunity for new entrants to move their products from development to deployment, network providers will need to assess security risks associated with implementing a more diversified vendor environment and take appropriate actions. While not unique to Open RAN, potential security risks include, but are not limited to:

- insertion of malicious features during design.
- alteration of system behavior through illicit access points that exist due to hardware design weaknesses or architectural flaws.
- extraction of sensitive or secret information through unintended communications (side) channels.

Vendor Diversity Risks,"One basic paradigm of Open RAN is that a “more competitive and vibrant RAN supplier ecosystem with faster innovation”20 will improve the user experience. Operators may have differing views on deploying Open RAN. One uncertainty is if operators committing to Open RAN technology will need to expend greater efforts to test and integrate components at various layers of network functionality to ensure security and interoperability prior to deploying it in their production networks.

While a larger vendor marketplace may initially occur, operators may select and rely upon a smaller number of vendors in order to reduce the test and integration burden and subsequent risk. This may cause the supplier marketplace to shrink and lose some robustness, as the router vendor market consolidated in the first decade of this century.

The increased complexity of the Open RAN architecture and mix-vendor platforms and networks increase the difficulties of troubleshooting and problem isolation. Operators traditionally have kept the number of vendors high enough to encourage competition but low enough so that when there are problems with a particular platform, the operator can rely on that vendor’s expertise to resolve the issue. The multi-vendor network introduces an increased complexity in troubleshooting network issues.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,REPORT ON CHALLENGES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORAN TECHNOLOGY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO OVERCOME THEM
SMO Infiltration,"Current Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) functions in 5G networks rely on proprietary interfaces to provide management and orchestration to the RAN and are unique to each supplier. O-RAN introduces the SMO function to perform the 3GPP defined Network Manager functions with standardized interfaces for management and orchestration as shown in Figure 5 below. Securing the SMO and its associated interfaces is imperative because it is responsible for all service management and orchestration. A security vulnerability within the SMO could be exploited to serve as an entry point to other Open RAN components and lateral movement across Open RAN for attacks on RAN confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity.

The SMO also accesses internal and external data stores through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which must be securely implemented so that data at rest, in motion, and in use are protected. An external attacker could poison external data controlled by another third-party who has not implemented proper security controls. After the poisoned data is imported to the SMO via the External interfaces, as shown in Figure 6, the external attacker could exploit it to gain access to the O-RAN ecosystem to degrade performance or perform reconnaissance.",FALSE,FALSE,SMO,External Interfaces,REPORT ON CHALLENGES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORAN TECHNOLOGY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO OVERCOME THEM
Conflicting xApp/rApp Policies,"The risk of conflicting policies and parameter settings increases as the number of application vendors increases.

An external RF-cyber-attack could affect the downstream Ethernet-based Precision Time Protocols (PTP), Master Clock, Transparent Clock, and Boundary Clock, among other synchronization and timing elements.

Multi-RAT Vulnerabilities,"Heterogeneous Radio Access Technology (RAT) networks require secure RAN orchestration such that the latest O-RAN-based 5G standalone deployment can securely coexist with other types of 5G and legacy systems, referred to as multi-RAT. An O-RAN-based 5G network deployment by itself can exhibit almost ideal performance but placed in the presence of other RAT networks or devices, chaotic and unsecure performance can emerge. Multi-RAT challenges overall network security by introducing threat variables to assure optimal O-RAN orchestration performance for secure coexistence in the presence of multiple threat variables and attack surfaces.  Multi-RAT increases exposure of the network's attack surface to malicious actors. Since Open RAN decouples the software from the hardware and moves orchestration to a cloud-native environment, orchestration can become automated and easily untrusted. Additionally, the RATs are vendor agnostic, creating an unknown attack surface between multi-vendor solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,ALL,ALL,REPORT ON CHALLENGES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORAN TECHNOLOGY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO OVERCOME THEM
Adversarial Machine Learning,"ML-based systems may suffer from a special type of logical vulnerabilities that stem from the inherent properties of the machine learning algorithms. For instance, an adversary can utilize AML, where ML models are susceptible to adversarial samples that appear as normal samples but have some imperceptible noise added to them with the intention of spoofing a trained classifier and misclassifying the input. This mechanism potentially allows an adversary to exploit the ML in a way to gain control of the network and exfiltrate information/data to degrade network performance or to gain control of the network for other malicious purposes. It is therefore necessary to consider ways of detecting and blocking adversaries in real time that could exploit ML-based vulnerabilities to their advantage.
